Designer News Profile Image Hack
=========================

Designer News profile images are intended to be 20x20px black and white bitmaps drawn in the browser.

With this you can set your profile image as a 20x20px bitmap in full color, from an image file.

Layervault will probably fix this super fast, but hey, fun in the meantime.

**Update**

It's been fixed. I'll keep this up for posterity though.
